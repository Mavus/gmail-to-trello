Trello integration using google scripts.

First attemp at google scripts, so thought i'd build something I can actually use.

Step by step instructions will follow shorty.  If you have worked with the Trello api and google scripts you should be able to get this up and running without to much hassle.

Running this script allows you to automatically create cards on your trello boards by just labeling your emails. The subject of the email will be used as the card name and the body of the mail as the description.  I'm planning to automatically transfer attachemtns etc.

Your labels need to have the following layout: trello: boardName, listName

Note: this is very alpha.

enjoy
